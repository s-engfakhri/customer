# customer
##Overview
The purpose of this project is to preprocess and analyze customer data from a shopping mall. This analysis is part of a broader objective to segment customers based on their spending habits, age, and other attributes to aid in targeted marketing and business strategy development.

###Features
-Handles missing data by filling with mean or median values.
-Identifies and removes duplicate rows.
-Renames columns for improved clarity and usability.
-Provides a summary of value distributions for key features.
-Prepares the dataset for advanced analytics or visualization.

###Dataset
The dataset used is Mall_Customers.csv. It contains the following columns:
-CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer (removed during preprocessing).
-Genre: Gender of the customer.
-Age: Age of the customer.
-Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
-Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned based on customer spending patterns.
**Note: The dataset should be included in the repository or linked externally if it's too large.
